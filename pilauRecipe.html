            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                GA classic pilau is a fragrant, spiced rice dish made by cooking rice with a combination of aromatic spices such as cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves, often paired with meat (like chicken, beef, or goat) or a vegetarian option. The dish is typically prepared by frying onions, garlic, and ginger in oil, then adding tomatoes and broth to create a savory base. The rice absorbs the rich flavors of the spices and broth, resulting in a deliciously fragrant, savory, and hearty meal. Pilau is a beloved comfort food, often served with side dishes like salad or fried plantains, and is popular across many cultures, especially in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent.

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Rice: Rinse 2 cups of rice under cold water to remove excess starch. Soak the rice for 20-30 minutes, then drain.</li>
                <li>Cook the Meat or Vegetables: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil or ghee in a large pot. Brown 1 lb of meat (chicken, beef, or goat) or sauté vegetables. Remove and set aside.</li>
                <li>Sauté the Aromatics: In the same pot, add 1 tablespoon of oil, then sauté 2 chopped onions until golden. Add 3 minced garlic cloves and 1 tablespoon grated ginger, cooking until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add Spices: Stir in 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 3-4 cloves, 2-3 cardamom pods, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add Tomatoes: Add 2 chopped tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes until softened.</li>
                <li>Combine Rice and Meat/Vegetables: Return the cooked meat or vegetables to the pot and add the drained rice. Stir gently to combine.</li>
                <li>Add Broth and Cook: Pour in 1 1/2 - 2 cups of broth or water, ensuring the rice is covered. Add salt to taste. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer on low for 20-25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Rest the Pilau: Once cooked, remove the pot from heat and let it rest, covered, for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Fluff and Serve: Fluff the rice with a fork and serve, garnished with fresh coriander or fried onions if desired.</li>
