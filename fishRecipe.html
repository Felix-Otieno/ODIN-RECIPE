            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Fried fish is a popular dish made by coating fish fillets with a seasoned batter or flour mixture, then
                frying them in hot oil until golden and crispy. The process typically begins with marinating the fish in
                spices or lemon juice for extra flavor. The fillets are then dredged in flour, often mixed with salt,
                pepper, and other seasonings, before being deep-fried or pan-fried to achieve a crispy outer crust while
                maintaining the fish's tender and flaky interior. The result is a flavorful, crunchy exterior with a
                juicy, delicate fish inside. Fried fish is often served with sides like rice, chips, or a simple salad,
                and garnished with lemon wedges or fresh herbs.

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Clean and pat the fish fillets dry to remove any moisture.</li>
                <li>Season the fillets with salt, black pepper, and optional spices like garlic powder, paprika, or a
                    squeeze of lemon/lime juice. Let the fish marinate for 10-15 minutes if desired.</li>
                <li>In a shallow bowl, mix flour with salt, black pepper, and optional spices like paprika or cayenne
                    pepper. You can add cornmeal for extra crunch.</li>
                <li>Coat each fish fillet evenly with the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.</li>
                <li>Heat enough oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat to submerge the fish halfway. Test the oil by
                    dropping a small amount of flour into it; it should sizzle when ready.</li>
                <li>Carefully place the fish fillets into the hot oil, frying them for 3-4 minutes on each side until
                    golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li>Remove the fish from the oil using tongs and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain
                    any excess oil.</li>
                <li>Serve the fried fish immediately with lemon wedges and your favorite side dishes. Enjoy!</li>
